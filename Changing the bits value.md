*This is a binary machine code.
*You can translate the code into assemble machine code via the instruction set.
This program is aimed to change the values of two higher bits and two lower bits of a four bits hexadecimal number,
e.g. x1234 changes into x3412.
Update:The simplified Chinese explanatory notes have been translated into the English ver.(the simplified Chinese ver. is kept).
Update2:bro go to see the CS2 FISSURE final,upload code tomorrow or farther futureXD.2025-07-20 20:47:11
Update3:Translating is time consuming.Now upload accomplished.2025-07-23 16:31:31
Update4:Additional remark:the 4-bit hexadecimal number is stored in the address x3500 in advance,and the result will be stored in x3501.2025-07-23 16:37:39
